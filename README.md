# Recommendation System - Over View

Recommendation System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the user’s choices.
Recommendation systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general.I have selected movie recomendation system among these.

A Recommendation System is one of the most famous applications of data science and machine learning.This project is done with help of a dataset.

## Types

1.Collaborative filtering :
Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from user’s past behavior (i.e. items purchased or searched by the user) as well as similar decisions made by other users.
This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that user may have an interest in.

2.Content-based filtering :
Content-based filtering approaches uses a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.
Content-based filtering methods are totally based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s preferences. It recommends items based on user’s past preferences.

3.Demographic Filtering :
They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre.
The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different this approach is considered to be too simple. 
The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.
